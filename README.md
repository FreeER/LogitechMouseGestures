# LogitechMouseGestures
Lua script for basic mouse gestures

## How to use:
In your Logitech Gaming Software Panel right click the profile in which you want the script to be running (for instance Standard for your normal desktop environment). Go to "Create Script" and just paste or import the code from GitHub. Mat recommends using a dedicated mouse button because the software seems to be treating reserved mouse buttons differently.

## Gestures:
Name | Action  | Description
---- | ------- | -----------
Close Tab | Left | Closes the tab via ctrl+w
Close window | gshift+Left | Closes the window via alt+F4
Reopen Tab | Right | Reopens a tab via ctrl+shift+t
Home | Up | presses home to go to the top of a page/list
End | Down | presses End to go to the end of a page/list
Alt+tab | Center | presses alt tab to tab between last window (ctrl+center will leave it open and use arrows + enter to select)
